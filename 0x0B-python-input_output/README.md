# 0x0B. Python - Input/Output: Learning Objectives

In this project, I learned various concepts and techniques related to file input/output and data serialization in Python. By the end of this project, I am now able to explain the following topics without the help of Google:

## General
- The awesomeness of Python programming and its wide range of applications.
- Opening a file in Python using the `open()` function and specifying the file mode.
- Writing text content to a file using the `write()` method or the `print()` function.
- Reading the full content of a file using the `read()` method or reading line by line using the `readline()` or `readlines()` methods.
- Moving the cursor within a file using the `seek()` method.
- Ensuring proper file handling and closing files after using them to free up system resources.
- Understanding and utilizing the `with` statement to automatically handle file closing.
- Understanding the basics of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and its role in data interchange.
- Serialization, the process of converting a Python data structure into a JSON string.
- Deserialization, the process of converting a JSON string into a Python data structure.
- Converting a Python data structure to a JSON string using the `json.dumps()` function.
- Converting a JSON string to a Python data structure using the `json.loads()` function.

These skills have provided me with a solid foundation in handling file input/output operations and working with JSON data in Python.
