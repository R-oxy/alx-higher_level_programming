# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

This project is part of my journey in learning Python. In this project, I explored the concept of Test-driven development (TDD) and gained a deeper understanding of its importance in software development. TDD is a development approach that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I have achieved the following learning objectives:

1. I now understand why Python programming is awesome. Python is a versatile and powerful language that offers numerous benefits such as its simplicity, readability, extensive library support, and strong community.

2. I have learned about interactive tests, which are tests that allow for user interaction during the testing process. These tests are valuable for simulating real-world scenarios and validating user input.

3. I have gained a clear understanding of why tests are important in software development. Tests help ensure the correctness and reliability of code, catch bugs early on, facilitate code maintenance, and provide documentation for future developers.

4. I have learned how to write Docstrings to create tests. Docstrings are used to document functions, classes, and modules in Python. By including tests within Docstrings, I can create self-contained documentation that serves as executable tests.

5. I now know how to write documentation for each module and function. Documentation is crucial for maintaining code readability and ensuring that other developers can understand and use the code effectively. Clear and concise documentation improves code maintainability and collaboration.

6. I have learned about the basic option flags used to create tests. These flags provide additional functionality to tests, such as enabling verbose output, running specific tests, or generating coverage reports. Understanding these options allows me to customize and optimize the testing process.

7. I have gained knowledge of finding edge cases. Edge cases are specific inputs or scenarios that are at the boundary or extreme conditions of the problem domain. Identifying and testing edge cases helps uncover potential issues or limitations in the code and ensures its robustness.

Throughout this project, I have applied these concepts and techniques to write tests and documentation for various Python modules and functions. This hands-on experience has strengthened my understanding of Test-driven development and enhanced my skills in writing reliable and well-documented code.
