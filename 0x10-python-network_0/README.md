# Project 0x10 - Python - Network #0

In this project, I delved into the fascinating world of network communications and web technologies. I gained a comprehensive understanding of key concepts and components that underpin the World Wide Web. Here's a summary of what I learned:

## Learning Objectives

### General

1. **URLs (Uniform Resource Locators):** I grasped the significance of URLs in web navigation and how they are used to locate and access resources on the internet.

2. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** I explored the HTTP protocol, which forms the foundation of data communication on the web, and understood its key features and functionalities.

3. **Reading URLs:** I learned how to analyze and interpret URLs, breaking down their components such as the scheme, domain name, sub-domain, port number, and query string.

4. **HTTP URL Scheme:** I understood the structure of HTTP URLs and how they are constructed, including the scheme used to define the protocol.

5. **Domain Names:** I gained insight into domain names, which serve as human-readable labels for IP addresses, allowing us to navigate the web easily.

6. **Sub-Domains:** I explored sub-domains and how they are used to organize and categorize content within larger domains.

7. **Port Numbers:** I learned how to specify port numbers in a URL, which helps direct network traffic to the appropriate service or application.

8. **Query Strings:** I discovered the significance of query strings in URLs and how they enable passing data to web servers for dynamic content generation.

9. **HTTP Requests:** I delved into HTTP requests, understanding their role in client-server communication and how they are structured.

10. **HTTP Responses:** I explored HTTP responses, which are used by web servers to provide requested resources and how they contain status codes and response bodies.

11. **HTTP Headers:** I learned about HTTP headers, which convey important information about the request or response, such as content type or encoding.

12. **HTTP Message Body:** I understood the concept of the HTTP message body, which carries the actual data being transmitted between client and server.

13. **HTTP Request Methods:** I became familiar with common HTTP request methods like GET, POST, and PUT, and when to use each one.

14. **HTTP Response Status Codes:** I learned about HTTP response status codes, which indicate the outcome of a request, such as success or error.

15. **HTTP Cookies:** I explored HTTP cookies, which are used for session management and personalization of web experiences.

16. **cURL:** I discovered how to use the cURL tool to make HTTP requests from the command line, gaining practical experience in sending requests and receiving responses.

17. **Browser Navigation:** I gained insights into what happens when I enter a URL like "google.com" in my web browser at the application level, including DNS resolution and HTTP requests.

By the end of this project, I acquired a solid foundation in web-related concepts and technologies, enabling me to navigate and understand the intricacies of the World Wide Web.
