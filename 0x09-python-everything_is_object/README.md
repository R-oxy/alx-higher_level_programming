# 0x09. Python - Everything is object

In this project, I learned about the fundamental concept of objects in Python. By the end of this project, I can confidently explain the following topics without the help of Google:

## General

* The awesomeness of Python programming and its versatility.
* Understanding what an object is and how it relates to Python programming.
* Distinguishing between a class and an object (or instance) and their respective roles.
* Recognizing the difference between immutable and mutable objects and their characteristics.
* Grasping the concept of references and their significance in Python.
* Understanding the process of assignment and its implications on objects.
* Familiarity with the concept of an alias and its implications in Python programming.
* Knowing the techniques to determine if two variables are identical or linked to the same object.
* Displaying the variable identifier (memory address) in the CPython implementation.
* Understanding the distinction between mutable and immutable objects.
* Identifying the built-in mutable types provided by Python.
* Identifying the built-in immutable types provided by Python.
* Understanding how Python passes variables to functions.

By gaining a solid understanding of these concepts, I have deepened my knowledge of Python's object-oriented nature and enhanced my ability to utilize the language effectively.

Feel free to explore the project and discover the fascinating world of Python objects!
