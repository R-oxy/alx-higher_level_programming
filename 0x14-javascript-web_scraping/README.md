# 0x14. JavaScript - Web Scraping, Scripting, API

## Introduction
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm diving into the fascinating world of JavaScript, focusing on web scraping, scripting, and APIs. This project is my playground to explore and understand these concepts deeply. If you're as excited about JavaScript as I am, stick around to see what I've learned!

## Learning Objectives

### General

#### Why JavaScript Programming is Amazing
JavaScript is nothing short of incredible. It's versatile, running on both the client and server sides. The community is vast, and the ecosystem is rich. Whether it's web development, server-side scripting, or even machine learning, JavaScript has something for everyone.

#### How to Manipulate JSON Data
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the lifeblood of data in JavaScript. I've learned how to parse JSON data and manipulate it for various use-cases. It's simpler than XML and super lightweight.

#### How to Use Request and Fetch API
Making HTTP requests is a piece of cake in JavaScript. I've gotten my hands dirty with both the `request` library and the native `fetch` API. Whether it's GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE, I've got it covered.

#### How to Read and Write a File Using fs Module
Node.js comes with a built-in `fs` (File System) module, and it's a game-changer. I can read, write, and manipulate files right from my JavaScript code. It's as simple as `fs.readFile()` and `fs.writeFile()`.

## Getting Started
