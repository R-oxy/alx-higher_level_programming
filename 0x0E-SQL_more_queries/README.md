# SQL - More Queries: Learning Objectives

In this project, I've delved deeper into SQL queries, and I'm excited to share what I've learned. By the end of this project, I can confidently explain the following concepts to anyone:

## General
- **Creating a New MySQL User:** I've gained a solid understanding of how to create new MySQL users, granting them access to databases and tables.

- **Managing User Privileges:** I've learned how to manage privileges for users, controlling their access to specific databases or tables, which is crucial for security and data management.

- **Understanding PRIMARY KEY:** I now grasp the importance of PRIMARY KEYs in database design. They are unique identifiers for records in a table, ensuring data integrity.

- **Exploring FOREIGN KEY:** I've learned about FOREIGN KEYs, which establish relationships between tables. This enhances data consistency and enables efficient querying.

- **Using NOT NULL and UNIQUE Constraints:** I understand how to use constraints like NOT NULL and UNIQUE to ensure data validity and prevent duplicates.

- **Retrieving Data from Multiple Tables:** I've acquired the skill to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single SQL query, reducing the need for multiple requests.

- **Subqueries:** I now know what subqueries are and how they can be used to retrieve data from one table based on the data from another.

- **Understanding JOIN and UNION:** I've delved into the concepts of JOIN and UNION, which allow me to combine data from different tables and perform more complex queries efficiently.

I'm excited to apply these concepts in my data analysis and software development journey, enhancing my capabilities and making more informed decisions based on data.
