# 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle: Learning Objectives

In this project, I gained a deeper understanding of various concepts and techniques in Python. By the end of this project, I am now able to explain the following topics without the help of Google:

## General
- Understanding the importance and implementation of Unit testing in a large project.
- Serializing and deserializing a Class object using different serialization formats.
- Writing and reading data from JSON files in Python.
- Utilizing the `*args` syntax to pass a variable number of non-keyword arguments to a function.
- Leveraging the `**kwargs` syntax to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function.
- Handling named arguments in function definitions and understanding their behavior.

This project has provided me with valuable insights into these Python concepts and has enhanced my overall understanding of the language.
