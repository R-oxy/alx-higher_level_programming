# Project 0x11: Python - Network #1

## Description
In this project, I learned how to work with network resources in Python. I explored two essential libraries for making HTTP requests: `urllib` and `requests`. These libraries allowed me to fetch internet resources, decode HTTP responses, make various types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, etc.), and manipulate data retrieved from external services.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I can confidently explain the following concepts to others without the need for external assistance:

- How to use the Python package `urllib` to fetch internet resources.
- How to decode the body of an HTTP response obtained using `urllib`.
- How to work with the Python package `requests`, which simplifies working with HTTP requests compared to `urllib`.
- How to make HTTP GET requests to retrieve data from web resources.
- How to make different types of HTTP requests such as POST, PUT, and more.
- How to fetch resources in JSON format.
- How to manipulate and process data obtained from external web services.

Throughout this project, I gained valuable knowledge and skills related to web interactions in Python, enabling me to work with data from various internet sources efficiently.
