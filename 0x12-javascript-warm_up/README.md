# JavaScript Warm-up

Welcome to my "0x12. JavaScript - Warm-up" project! In this project, I'm embarking on a journey to explore the fascinating world of JavaScript programming. By the end of this project, I expect to have a solid understanding of fundamental JavaScript concepts and techniques. Allow me to provide you with an overview of what I've learned.

## Learning Objectives

### General
- **Why JavaScript programming is amazing**: I'll discover the power and versatility of JavaScript and why it's my go-to language for web development.

- **How to run a JavaScript script**: I'll learn how to execute JavaScript code in different environments.

- **How to create variables and constants**: I'll understand the concepts of variable declaration using `var`, `const`, and `let`.

- **What are differences between var, const, and let**: I'll explore the differences between these variable declaration keywords and when to use each.

- **What are all the data types available in JavaScript**: I'll get acquainted with the various data types that JavaScript supports.

- **How to use the if, if ... else statements**: I'll master conditional statements to control the flow of my code.

- **How to use comments**: I'll learn the importance of code comments for documentation and readability.

- **How to assign values to variables**: I'll discover the syntax for assigning values to variables.

- **How to use while and for loops**: I'll dive into looping structures for repetitive tasks.

- **How to use break and continue statements**: I'll explore ways to control loops with `break` and `continue`.

- **What is a function and how do you use functions**: I'll understand the concept of functions, their roles, and how to create and use them.

- **What does a function that does not use any return statement return**: I'll grasp the concept of return values and what happens when a function doesn't explicitly return anything.

- **Scope of variables**: I'll delve into variable scope and its impact on my code.

- **What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them**: I'll learn about arithmetic operators for performing mathematical operations.

- **How to manipulate dictionaries**: I'll explore data manipulation techniques using JavaScript objects.

- **How to import a file**: I'll understand how to include external files in my JavaScript code.

This project is equipping me with essential JavaScript knowledge, setting a strong foundation for my programming journey. Happy coding!
