# Project 0x15: JavaScript - Web jQuery

This project focuses on using JavaScript and jQuery to enhance front-end web development. It covers various concepts and skills, including DOM manipulation, API interactions, and event handling. The goal is to understand how jQuery simplifies front-end programming and makes it more efficient.

## General Concepts

1. **JavaScript in the Browser:** JavaScript is a crucial language for web development, enabling interactivity and dynamic behavior in web pages.

2. **Dealing with Data Statically vs. Dynamically:** The project emphasizes updating web page content dynamically without requiring full page reloads.

## Resources

- **Selectors:** Learn how to target HTML elements for manipulation.
- **Get and Set Content:** Understand how to retrieve and modify the content within HTML elements.
- **Manipulate CSS Classes:** Add, remove, or toggle CSS classes on HTML elements.
- **Manipulate DOM Elements:** Master the art of manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM).
- **API (Application Programming Interface):** Explore how to interact with APIs for data retrieval.
- **Introduction to GET & POST Requests:** Understand how to make GET and POST requests for data exchange.
- **jQuery:** Discover the power of jQuery, a JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation and AJAX interactions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I aim to:

- Comprehend why jQuery is a valuable tool for front-end development.
- Know how to select HTML elements using JavaScript.
- Understand the differences between ID, class, and tag name selectors.
- Learn how to modify HTML element styles and content.
- Gain proficiency in modifying the DOM dynamically.
- Master making GET and POST requests using jQuery AJAX.
- Acquire skills in listening and binding to DOM and user events.

## Getting Started

To start working on this project, import jQuery in your HTML file's `<head>` section using the following script tag:

```html
<head>
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js"></script>
</head>
```
